Initially, I thought that this task would be difficult. But, as I began to do this task, it felt easier than expected. I learnt about PySide6, which helps us to create GUIs and applications. I created individiual functions to search for a pokemon, to capture a pokemon and to to display the captured pokemon. When we click on the **Search** button, it displays the image and the details of the pokemon gathered by calling the API in a QLabel. On clicking the **Capture** button, a folder called `captured` will be created if it does not exist and the image of the pokemon will be downloaded and added to this folder. If we have already "captured" the pokemon, it will show a warning. Else, it will show "Pokemon captured successfully!". Finally, a seperate widget has been created for displaying the captured pokemon, which will shown when **Display** is clicked. Two functions, `prev` and `next` helps in indexing while `update_info` function will update the display.
