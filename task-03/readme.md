This task was extremely easy. I was able to link the css file using the `href` attribute of the`<link>` tag and the js file using `src` attribute of `<script>`. For the next part, I created seperate functions for each audio file in `index.js` and linked it to each button using `onclick` attribute of the `<button>` tag. Then, I gave unique background colours to each button in their respective classes in `styles.css`. I also gave `box shadow` property to all of them by giving it in the common class `drum`. I was able to import unique fonts from Google Fonts and apply it using `<link>` tag.
