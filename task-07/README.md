This task was a bit diffcult and lengthy. My weather extension has two buttons: **Get Weather** and **Find my weather**. **Get Weather** fetches you the details of the city you input in searchbar; if you press it without entering a city name, it will show an error. The other button, **Find my weather**, fetches the weather details based on your location. It requires `geolocation` permission I specified in `manifest.json`. This extension displays the location, weather condition(Clouds, Mist etc.), temperature, and humidity.
